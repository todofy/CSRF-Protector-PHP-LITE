CSRF Protector LITE
==========================
CSRF Protector project is awesome, it automatically buffers output generated by php, and attaches the javascript code to HTML output. Also attaches hidden tokens in form to support NO-JS versions.

**CSRF Protector LITE** On the other hand, will use the model adopted by `CSRFP` but developer would have to separately add client side javascript code to HTML files and php library will deal with validation of requests. This will remove added overhead of output being buffered for eachr equest and modified.

PROS:
 - Faster, lesser overhead
 - Remove features you don't want :)

CONS:
 - Comparitively less easier to implement
